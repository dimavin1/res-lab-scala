PREFACE

This edition of Industrial Research Laboratories of the United States presents information which was collected from November 1959 to March 1960, and verified for accuracy and currency between May and July 1960. Every effort was made to give responsible officials of each firm the opportunity to “proof” the firm’s entry just before it was placed in the hands of the printer. It is hoped that the resulting last-minute alterations make this edition a current guide to industrial research activity in the United States.

Listings are limited to non-governmental laboratories devoted to fundamental and applied research, including development of products and processes. Laboratories performing only production control or commercial testing are not included. Most of the laboratories listed herein are owned and operated by industrial firms, but some university, foundation, and cooperative laboratories which have separate industrial research staffs and facilities are also included. Readers are invited to inspect the “Key to the Use of the Code” (immediately following this Preface) for an interpretation of the sponsorship of each laboratory and the availability of its research services.

The Directory presents information on 5,420 laboratories, a twelve per cent increase over the tenth edition. The policy of listing subsidiaries under their parent firms is given greater importance in the present compilation than in previous ones. For the first time, firms were specifically requested to indicate their parent or subsidiary status. This increased emphasis on the grouping of subsidiaries under parent firms results in a smaller increase in the number of firms than one would expect in view of the twelve per cent increase in the number of laboratories. Only in relatively few cases were known subsidiaries not listed under their parent firms; these exceptions resulted from the occasional reluctance of firms to clarify their exact corporate structure, or from specific requests that certain subsidiaries be listed as separate entities.

Approximately 23,000 questionnaires were mailed to industrial corporations known or believed to engage in research. Despite this effort to encompass the nation’s industrial research facilities, the present compilation should not be considered a population which is subject to statistical analyses. The questionnaire method may, in itself, introduce unknown biases. The National Academy of Sciences—National Research Council can accept no responsibility for the reliability of the information contained herein. Furthermore, the listing of a laboratory 

does not imply that it is approved by the National Academy of Sciences —National Research Council, nor does omission of a laboratory imply disapproval.

An important innovation in this edition is the personnel index containing approximately 20,000 names. Two classes of names are included in the personnel index: (1) individuals directly involved in research, or directly concerned with the hiring of the laboratory staff, and who are included in the firm’s entry in the main body of the Directory; and (2) other research executives in responsible positions who are not included in the firm’s entry in the main body of the Directory. The latter group is identified in the personnel index by italicized type. A name in italics in the personnel index is not to be found under the firm’s entry in the main body of the Directory. Numerous research executives were excluded from the firms’ entries in order to conserve space. On the other hand, it was felt that their listing in the personnel index would increase the usefulness of the Directory’ as a locational device.

Significant developments took place between the publication of the tenth and eleventh editions which may be of interest. Approximately 795 firms which were listed in the tenth edition could not be listed in the eleventh edition for the following reasons: some disqualified themselves as industrial research organizations in 1960, or declined to provide up-to-date information on their research activities; others had gone out of business, or had lost their identities through absorption by other firms; still others were simply lost. First-class mail addressed to the last group was returned unclaimed, and efforts to find new addresses were in vain. In the five-year interval from 1955 to 1960, therefore, approximately nineteen per cent of the firms in the tenth edition could no longer be considered units of industrial research. In this same period, of course, more than 795 new, research-active firms were established. Other changes which took place between the tenth and eleventh editions included the transformation of at least 110 independent firms into identifiable divisions or subsidiaries of other firms, and internal changes (additional laboratories, re-groupings of divisions, new names) in thousands of firms. These observations serve only to suggest the fluid nature of industrial research organization in the United States.

This work could not have been compiled without the support of many persons. Thanks must be given, first of all, to the thousands of individuals engaged in research who took time to “answer another questionnaire.” Special recognition must likewise be given to the work of Mrs. Sue Singer Krogfus, who painstakingly solved hundreds of problems that developed in the course of the compilation, and who contributed so much to editorial policy and procedures. The work of Miss Dina E. Van Bavel as editorial assistant for many months is also 

gratefully acknowledged. Other persons involved in the compilation included: Mr. Walter M. Whitlow, who was editor during the first stages of the work; the late Mr. Lee Michelson, who brought many years of editorial experience to the initial planning; Mr. Frank M. Holz, who provided extensive and valuable assistance on matters of content, style, and format; and a dozen other editorial assistants and typists whose work made the compilation possible.

KEY TO THE USE OF THE CODE

A two-part code showing the type of sponsorship of each laboratory and the kinds of services it performs appears in parentheses after the address of each entry, or after the addresses of individual laboratories where those of one company offer different services. Symbols are as follows:

Sponsorship: C—Laboratory established by a manufacturing company or other profit-making organization

I—Independent commercial laboratory established primarily for the purpose of selling research services

T—Laboratory organized by a trade association

N—Non-profit laboratory not sponsored by a trade association

Services: p—research performed for owners of laboratory only

f—research for others on fee or contract basis

c—consultation and advice for others

t—testing and analysis for others

NAME INDEX TO RESEARCH AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS

Numbers following individual names are references to entries, not to pages. Names listed in Roman type will be found under the entries in the main body of this Directory. Names in italics will not be found in the main body of this Directory. For the latter group, this index lists research or administrative titles, so that an individual’s position in his firm will be known.

EXAMPLES:

-   (1) Jones, Robert E., 2734G

(Since this name is in Roman type, it will be found, together with the individual's title or position, under entry number 2734G.)

-   (2) Smith, H. L., Asst. Lab. Dir., 1214J

(Since this name is in italics, it will not be found under entry 1214J. Reference to this entry will give the name and address of the firm, however, while the individual's position with that firm is indicated above.)
